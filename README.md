# Simple_CTF_Challenge
Hi! This is my first CTF challenge that I made which didn't turned out as expected but will be making a better one Next time and will try to upload it in Vulnhub or Hackthebox , The Challenge is hosted on Docker 
All you need is to find the Password hidden somewhere in the web app and find the flag at backdoor.zip

```
# Install Docker
./docker_install.sh

# Start Docker

```
